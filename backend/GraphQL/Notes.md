## GraphQL 
GraphQL is a query language . With the help of GraphQL you can get the exact data that you want from the API that you are requesting from.
This will help to get the under serverd data that we want . The problem with the REST API was that we were getting a lot of unwanted data from the API (overfetching) .
With the help of the GraphQL we can also get more than one data in a single request . This helpsin optimization of the app on slower mobiles as well.
It uses types in oprder to get a clear consize info of data that is requested with a benefit of getting low errors.

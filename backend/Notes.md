## Backend Notes

To run javascript code without depending on browser and without having restrictions that we have on 
browers . The solution to this is Node.js (Node.js is just another Js runtime) . The the software that execute the code is V8 engine developed by google . 

To enter the node enviornment :

We have to write `node` in the terminal after installing the node LTS from the official website.

After entering the node enviornment you can exit in the following ways
> .exit
> 
> ctrl + D

After entering the node by pressing the TAB two times . You will get buch of the Global variables that you can use i.e String , Number etc

You can go deep to get more Global functions tht are avaiable t the global variable by 
> String. (Hitting Tab)

_ underscore is also a great thing in node it represents the PREVIOUS RESULT 
>i.e 2*3=6 , _-2=4.

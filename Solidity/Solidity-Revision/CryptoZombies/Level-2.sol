NOTES

MAPPINGS
Mappings is the another way of storing data it is different from arrays in array we have to store data in a sequential way but in mapping
we could associate any value to any type of key

mapping (address => uint) public accountBalance;
We can write mapping likee this in which one type is associated to the other type




contract something{

mapping(uint=> string) public rollToName;
function acssociate(uint256 _roll , string memory _name)public{
rollToName[_roll] = _name;
}

}

msg.sender and many others are global variables that are available to all functions.


REQUIRE
require makes it so that the function will throw an error and stop executing if some condition is not true.
It works like a gaurd clause , means if the condition is true then proceede the function else throw aa error.

function sayHiToVitalik(string memory _name) public returns (string memory) {
  // (Side note: Solidity doesn't have native string comparison, so we
  // compare their keccak256 hashes to see if the strings are equal)
  
  require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_name)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked("Vitalik")));     //Throws an error and exits if not true.
  
  return "Hi!";
}



INHERITANCE
Rather than making one extremely long contract, sometimes it makes sense to split your code logic across multiple contracts to organize the code.
One feature of Solidity that makes this more manageable is contract inheritance
we can use inheritance by 

contract Dog{
//some contract stuffs
}

contract BabyDog is Dog{      // by using the is keyword  
//some contract stuff
}



IMPORT
Splitting the contract up into multiple files to make it more manageable. This is normally how you will handle long codebases in your Solidity projects
using a import statement

import 'someotercontract.sol';



STORAGE AND MEMORY
There are two locations you can store variables — in storage and in memory;
Storage refers to variables stored permanently on the blockchain.
Memory variables are temporary, and are erased between external function calls to your contract



Internal and External
In addition to public and private, Solidity has two more types of visibility for functions: internal and external.
internal is the same as private, except that it's also accessible to contracts that inherit from this contract.
external is similar to public, except that these functions can ONLY be called outside the contract — they can't be called by other functions inside that contract.


INTERFACES
For our contract to talk to another contract on the blockchain that we don't own, first we need to define an interface.
Lets suppose this is a contract on blockchain

contract LuckyNumber {
  mapping(address => uint) numbers;
  function setNum(uint _num) public {
    numbers[msg.sender] = _num;
  }
  
  function getNum(address _myAddress) public view returns (uint) {
    return numbers[_myAddress];
  }
  
}
and we want to access the getNum function then First we'd have to define an interface of the LuckyNumber contract by


contract NumberInterface {                                             //also we dont have any state variable
  function getNum(address _myAddress) public view returns (uint);      //notice we dont have curly braces here , by this way compiler will know its a interface
}



contract otherContract{
NumberInterface numberContract = NumberInterface(contractAddress);   //first we will initialize in the contract in which we want to use the interface
function someFunction() public {
    uint num = numberContract.getNum(msg.sender);                 //this is how we use it
  
  }
}
